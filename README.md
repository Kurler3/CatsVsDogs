# CatsVsDogs
Using Pytorch to classify whether the inputted image contains a cat or a dog.

The data used for this project was obtained in the competition "Dogs Vs Cats" in Kaggle. The data downloaded came in two folders (train and test).
Then I wrote a script to create a csv file with each image's path and label per row, making it easy to load with pandas.
